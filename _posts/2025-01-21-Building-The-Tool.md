## Week 1

In the first week of our project, we discussed which Large Language Model (LLM) we wanted to use in our program. We only needed the LLM to do basic functions and what web scraping tools are best to use. We considered using [Jina AI](https://jina.ai/), [Crawl4AI](https://crawl4ai.com/mkdocs/), and [llama 3.2 3B](https://www.llama.com/).

## Week 2

After discussing which AI models to use with fine-tuning, we decided to use [Claude AI](https://www.anthropic.com/claude) along with RAG 

This is a raw snippet:

```
hello world
123
This is a text snippet
```

This is a PHP snippet:

```php
<?php
    echo 'Hello, World!';
?>
```

This is a JavaScript snippet:

```js
const add = (a, b) => a + b
const minus = (a, b) => a - b

console.log(add(100,200))  // 300
console.log(minus(100,200))  // -100
```

This is a Python snippet:

```python
def say_hello():
    print("hello world!")

say_hello()   // "hello world!"
```
