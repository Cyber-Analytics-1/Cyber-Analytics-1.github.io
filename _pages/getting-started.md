You'll also need to create an env file containing the claude api key. Let me know when you need it and I'll send it over.

At this point, you should be good to run the program by running python main.py
### Step 1) Make sure you have pip and python installed on your computer.


You must use Python Version 3.11.9, and create a virtual environment

### Step 2) Create your virtual environment

In your terminal run

python3.11 -m venv myenv

followed by

myenv/Scripts/Activate

### Step 3) Install dependencies

To install dependencies you must run 

pip install -r requirements.txt

You must also create a .env file with a Claude AI key and a NewsAI key
