## Who Are We
We are a student group project consisting of [Ryder Shintaku](https://github.com/rydershintaku), [Adam Winfield-Smith](https://www.linkedin.com/in/adamwinsmith/), and [Sam Doan](https://www.linkedin.com/in/doansam/). Our Group is sponsored by [Mehdi Tarrit Mirakhorli]() and assisted by [Derek Garcia](https://www.linkedin.com/in/derek-garcia/). 

## Background

In recent years, there has been a significant rise in cyber threats posed by malicious state actors, commonly referred to as Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs). These sophisticated and well-resourced groups are increasingly targeting critical infrastructure and government systems, with a notable surge in attacks against the United States government originating from China-based threat actors. Among the most prominent APT groups are Salt Typhoon, Volt Typhoon, and Silk Typhoon, which have been actively exploiting vulnerabilities to infiltrate protected systems.

These APTs leverage a combination of legacy software, system misconfigurations, and unpatched software vulnerabilities to gain unauthorized access to sensitive networks. Their operations are characterized by stealth, persistence, and a high degree of coordination, enabling them to maintain long-term access to compromised systems while evading detection. The growing frequency and complexity of these attacks underscore the urgent need for enhanced cybersecurity measures to defend against these evolving threats.

## Our Goal

To combat this issue effectively we developed a tool capable of scraping and aggregating data related to Typhoon Actors and their activities. By collecting and analyzing this data, it can be passed to Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate detailed, actionable intelligence reports. These reports would provide insights into the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) employed by these threat actors, enabling cybersecurity professionals to identify vulnerabilities, predict potential attack vectors, and implement proactive defense strategies. Such a tool would not only enhance situational awareness but also empower organizations to stay ahead of these persistent and evolving threats.
