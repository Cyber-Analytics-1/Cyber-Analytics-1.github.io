## Who Are We
We are a student group project consisting of [Ryder Shintaku](https://github.com/rydershintaku), [Adam Winfield-Smith](https://www.linkedin.com/in/adamwinsmith/), and [Sam Doan](https://www.linkedin.com/in/doansam/). Our Group is sponsored by [Mehdi Tarrit Mirakhorli](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mehdi-tarrit-mirakhorli/) and assisted by [Derek Garcia](https://www.linkedin.com/in/derek-garcia/). 

## Background

- There are an increasing number of malicious state actors1, known as Advanced Persistent Threat (APTs)
- Recently, rise in attacks against the US Government from China-Based attackers
- Salt Typhoon, Volt Typhoon, Silk Typhoon, etc2
APTs take advantage of legacy software, misconfigurations, and other software vulnerabilities to access protected systems


## Our Goal

To combat this issue we developed a tool capable of scraping and aggregating data related to Typhoon Actors and their activities. By collecting and analyzing this data, it can be passed to Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate detailed intelligence reports. These reports would provide insights into the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) employed by these threat actors, enabling cybersecurity professionals to identify vulnerabilities, predict potential attack vectors, and implement defense strategies.
## Features
