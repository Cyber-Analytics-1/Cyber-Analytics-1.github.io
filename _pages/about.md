## Who We Are
We are a student group project from the University of Hawaii At MƒÅnoa consisting of [Ryder Shintaku](https://github.com/rydershintaku), [Adam Winfield-Smith](https://www.linkedin.com/in/adamwinsmith/), and [Sam Doan](https://www.linkedin.com/in/doansam/). Our Group is sponsored by [Mehdi Tarrit Mirakhorli](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mehdi-tarrit-mirakhorli/) and assisted by [Derek Garcia](https://www.linkedin.com/in/derek-garcia/). 

## Background

There have been an increasing number of malicous state actors known as Advanced Persistent Threats. So recently groups like Salt Typhoon, Volt Typhoon, Silk Typhoon, and etc have been attacking the US Government. These APTs take advantage of legacy software, misconfigurations, and other software vulnerabilities to access protected systems.
## Our Goal

To combat this issue we developed a tool capable of scraping recent and relevant data from the internet and aggregating data related to Typhoon Actors and their activities. By collecting and analyzing this data, it can be passed to Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate detailed intelligence reports. These reports would provide insights into the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) employed by these threat actors, enabling cybersecurity professionals to identify vulnerabilities, predict potential attack vectors, and implement defense strategies.
